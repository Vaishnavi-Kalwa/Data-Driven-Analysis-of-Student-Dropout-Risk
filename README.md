# Data-Driven Analysis of Student Dropout Risk
Analyzed factors influencing student dropout, enrollment, and graduation status using machine learning models to predict outcomes and identify high-risk profiles.

# Description 
Collected and prepared a dataset from Kaggle, performing thorough data cleaning to address missing values and outliers. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions and correlations. Selected key features influencing the target variable through correlation analysis and statistical evaluation. Due to unmet regression assumptions, employed various classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM, achieving a best model accuracy of 74.9%.

# PowerBI
Imported transformed data into Power BI to create interactive dashboards. Visualized key metrics and risk factors such as scholarship availability, curriculum load, and age at enrollment, supporting clearer interpretation of student dropout risks.
# Conclusion

The analysis identified scholarship availability, high academic load (over 10 units per semester), and older age at enrollment as key factors contributing to student dropout risk. Dropout likelihood increases with age and heavier course loads.
# Recommendations
* Streamline curriculum by reducing the number of academic units per semester and incorporating extracurricular activities to promote balance.

* Provide adequate scholarship support to ease financial burdens and improve student retention.
