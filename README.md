# Student-Dropout-Risk-Analysis
Analyzing factors affecting students dropout, enrolling, graduate and predicting Target variables using machine learning models
# Descripition
Collected and loaded the data from kaggle. Searched for missing values and outliers. Performed exploratory data analysis. Transformed to a new data with required feilds which affects target variable and more correlated compared to other factors. Again performed exploratory data analysis to check whether the ouliers affect the data by plotting boxplot. Plotted histogram, bar chart and pie charts. As data does not satisfy regression assumptions, proceeded to employ various machine learning models to predict whether that person is Dropped out, graduated, enrolled and fitted best model with accuracy 74.9%.
# PowerBI
Imported data to PowerBI desktop and transformed data with key factors affecting target variable after analyzing it from the correlation matrix employed using python and constructed some visualiztions to understand risk rate.

# Conclusion

Key factors that affecting students is scholarships, units included in curriculum are more than 10, and age. As age at enrollment high the dropout rate increases as the number of units included in a curriculum in a semester are more.

# Recommendations
** Units in curriculum should be less. And should contain some extra curricular activities.

** Ensure that scholarships should be provided to the students.
