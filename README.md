# Student Dropout Prediction & Risk Analysis

# Project Overview

This project analyzes factors influencing student dropout, enrollment, and graduation status using machine learning models. The objective is to predict student outcomes and identify high-risk profiles to support early intervention strategies.

# Dataset & Data Preparation

Collected dataset from Kaggle

Performed comprehensive data cleaning

Handled missing values

Treated outliers

Standardized data formats

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand:

Variable distributions

Correlations between features

Patterns affecting dropout status

Key features were selected using correlation analysis and statistical evaluation to improve model performance.

# Machine Learning Models

Since regression assumptions were not satisfied, classification models were applied:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

Best Model Performance

Highest Accuracy Achieved: 74.9%

The models were used to predict whether a student is likely to drop out, remain enrolled, or graduate.

# Power BI Dashboard

The processed dataset was imported into Power BI to create interactive dashboards for better insight visualization.

Dashboard Highlights:

Dropout rate analysis

Scholarship availability impact

Curriculum load (units per semester)

Age at enrollment distribution

Risk segmentation

The dashboard enables stakeholders to visually interpret dropout risk factors and trends.

# Key Findings

The analysis identified the following major risk factors for student dropout:

Limited or no scholarship support

High academic load (more than 10 units per semester)

Older age at enrollment

Dropout probability increases with heavier course loads and higher enrollment age.

# Recommendations

Reduce academic unit load per semester to improve academic balance

Incorporate extracurricular activities to enhance student engagement

Expand scholarship support to reduce financial stress and improve retention

# Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
